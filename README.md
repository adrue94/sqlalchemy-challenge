# sqlalchemy-challenge

The content this week has a lot of copy/ paste, with some magic going on under the hood. I'm sure I'll understand how it works down the road, but from this week a lot of the SQLAlchemy was unintuitive. Still managed to finish the module assignment without too much worry, though slower due to using a single .py files instead of jupyter cells. 

Plotting, as always, is a nightmare.
